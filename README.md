## What's it about?
- In a nutshell, this is an educational application which builds a snowflake graph and searches through it to find a key value.
- You can specify the number of vertices to generate and the key to search for. 
- Every vertex has three children.
- Every vertex contains an unsorted array of 10 random integers.
- The application goes through the generated graph, sorts internal arrays with quickSort() and searches for a key value in the sorted array with binarySearch().
- If the key has been found or we are out of vertices to check, it is done.
